h1. Minotaur

Minotaur is a simple system to monitor the status of remote websites.  It consists of a Ruby script (monitor.rb), a JSON file (monitor.js), and a web page (monitor.html).

monitor.rb will continuously poll the status of a website and write the results to monitor.js in JSON format.

monitor.html will continuously reload monitor.js and update its contents based on the resulting status.

h2. Configuration

monitor.yml is where you define the sites you want to load.

<pre>
sites:
  google:
    url: www.google.com
  twitter:
    url: www.twitter.com
  paypal:
    url: https://www.paypal.com
</pre>
    
"http://" is assumed as the protocol.  To use https simply specify it in the url.

h2. Logging

Minotaur logs every ping to log/monitor.log.
