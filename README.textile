h1. Minotaur

Minotaur is a simple system to monitor the status of remote websites.  It consists of a Ruby script (monitor.rb), a JSON file (monitor.js), and a web page (monitor.html).

monitor.rb will continuously poll the status of a website and write the results to monitor.js in JSON format.

monitor.html will continuously reload monitor.js and update its contents based on the resulting status.

h2. Configuration

config/monitor.yml is where you define the sites you want to load.

<pre>
sites:
  google:
    url: www.google.com
  twitter:
    url: www.twitter.com
  paypal:
    url: https://www.paypal.com
</pre>
    
"http://" is assumed as the protocol.  To use https simply specify it in the url.

h2. Logging

Minotaur logs every ping to log/monitor.log.
